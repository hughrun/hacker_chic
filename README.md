# Hacker Chic - a Ghost theme

This is a theme for the [Ghost](https://ghost.org) blogging platform.

You can see it in action at https://www.hughrundle.net

To use, simply download the whole repo, adjust the info in the footer located in default.hbs (licensing, email address and GitHub name), compress to a zip file, and upload into your blog in the Admin area. Everything is here, including fonts and icons.

## New in version 2.1.0
* Updated to be compliant with Ghost 1.0.
* replaced two/one column `float` based post listing with three/two/one column `column` based listing. Hooray for CSS3!
